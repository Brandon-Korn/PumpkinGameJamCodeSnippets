# Hello!

Here I made a public Github repo to showcase some of the code we used to make the Autumn Idle game for a weekend Game Jam

My name is Brandon Korn, and with 2 other Game Design students we made Autumn Idle in a weekend in the Unity game engine. 
I've included some of the code that I helped work on during the project for you to look at. 
Most of my responsibilities on the project were with the animations, upgrade system, and enemy systems. 

If you want to play the game, the Itch.io page for it is here:
